    <p class="paragraph">I’m a full-stack web developer who loves building real-world systems that actually get used — not just demos. I’ve spent the past few years developing internal CRM and ticketing platforms at TODAY Internet, combining Laravel, Vue 3 + Vuetify, and FastAPI microservices to manage everything from leads to customer operations.
I enjoy working across the full stack — designing clean APIs, optimizing SQL queries, improving UX flows, and setting up CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions. I’m hands-on, fast to learn, and comfortable taking ownership from frontend polish to backend logic and DevOps automation.
What motivates me most is joining a team that values good code, fast feedback, and building things that matter. If that sounds like [Company Name], I’d love to be part of it.</p>
